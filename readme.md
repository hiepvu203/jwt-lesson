# Summary
This is my self-study lesson on jwt to create login, registration, authentication and authorization features. Because I am self-taught, the commands may not be correct or optimized.

## Technologies used in the repo:
- Backend: ExpressJS,NodeJS, MongoDB (CloudDB)

### Note
Because this project is mainly about the backend, use postman to test the features in the project.
